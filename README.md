# VERY FUN WORD GAME

[Find my project here](https://davekuperman.github.io/Wooordle-project/)

VERY FUN WORD GAME is a game inspired by the extremely fun NY TIMES Wordle game. 

My approach to this game was to create a game which is "fun", attractive, responsive and easy on the eyes with a childish UI to entice the younger generation to also get involved.

Intention was there to add animations and sounds, but will have to be added into future iterations of the game.

The technologies used in this game are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Enjoy!
